# React Native Boilerplate

This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides **a solid foundation for building cross-platform mobile applications.** It emphasizes a clear separation of concerns between the UI and business logic, making it easier to maintain and scale your mobile app.

If you like the project, give us a star ðŸ¤©.
